    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's the last day of school before summer break, and one unfortunate high schooler, Dexter Reed, crashes his mother's car into that of his teacher (Sinbad).  In his newfound mission to find a summer job to pay off the damage to his teacher's car, Dexter's path crossess with a quirky and seemingly not-all-there burger shop worker named Ed who gets him a job at Good Burger.  Things get complicated when a new burger joint with very competetive prices, Mondo Burger, opens up accross the street.  Luckily for Good Burger, Ed has a secret sauce that could save their business!  <span class="spoil-protect">Once the manager of Mondo Burger realizes what is going on, he goes on the attack by trying to buy Ed, then hiring a spy (Carmen Electra) to trick Ed into giving up the recipe, then by calling in a favor to have Dexter and Ed locked up in a mental hospital.  When The grumpy old employee at Good Burger, Otis (Abe Vigoda), catches some of the Mondo Burger guys breaking in to Good Burger to compromise Ed's sauce with some shark poison, they get him sent away to join Ed and Dexter.  With the help of a really strong and tall patient, and a musical distraction by the godfather of funk, George Clinton, they're able to escape and put forth a plan to infiltrate Mondo Burger to expose the unethical methods of making the burgers larger for cheap.  Thanks to some quick thinking by Ed, Mondo Burger's illegal practices are put to an end and exposed, and the owner goes to jail.</span></p>
